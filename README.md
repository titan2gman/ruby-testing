# Influitive Work Sample Test

## Overview of Models

- **Contact**: A user within the system.
- **Referral**: The contact info of a potential customer that a Contact has
referred to the community.
- **Event**: A write-once log of events that happen in the system.

# Exercise Overview

For this exercise, you will create 2 API endpoints (for listing and creating
Referrals), and add more functionality to the Contact model.

Specs are already written that test the required functionality. Implement the
code such that all the tests pass.

1. Add an API endpoint for listing referrals, using the behaviour specified by
the `ReferralsController` specs.
2. Add an API endpoint for creating referrals, using the behaviour specified by
the `ReferralsController` specs.
3. Implement `Contact.for_leaderboard`, using the behaviour specified by the
`Contact` specs.
